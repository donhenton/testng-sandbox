command line testing invocation:
This runs the multithread profile
mvn clean test -P multithread





This invocation will set up the env.properties file to be pulled from
the src/env/alpha folder, and run the ngdemo.xml testng file

this demonstrates setting an environment AND requesting a specific set of
arbitrary tests
mvn clean test -Palpha -DtestNgFile=ngdemo

You must specify either the specific profiles (generic/multithread)
OR

a profile that sets and environment (alpha,beta) and then the testNgFile to run


mvn clean test -Palpha -DtestNgFile=generic 
is legal as well
